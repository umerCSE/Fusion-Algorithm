# Fusion Algorithm 
# Algorithm description
The algorithm is based off of mathematical and theoretical concepts.

# Plan of Attack 
The objective is to create sophisticated algorithmic based artificial intelligent models,
I can complete the following objective by using a simple formula of my creation. Coding is not 
necessary at this point, at this point a strong mathematical background is required.

# Plan of Defense
To make sure the artificial intelligent models that I create do not cross the line of control (LOC),
what I mean by that is that the A.I does not become greedy, insufficient, ignorant and disobey orders given
to the A.I .

# Attack Formula
# ⎧x_train + y_train⎫ + ⎧x_test + y_test⎫ = Prediction_Value
|_matrix1x2_{{x_{test}};{y_{test}}}=…,  |_matrix1x2_{{x_{train}};{y_{train}}}=Prediction Value
